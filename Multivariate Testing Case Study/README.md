# Case Study: Optimising User Engagement Through Multivariate Testing on a Tech News Website

## Background

The objective of this case study is to increase user engagement on a tech news website. Engagement metrics of interest include time spent on the site, the number of articles read per visit, and the frequency of social media shares. Initial analysis suggested that the homepage layout, article headlines, and featured images significantly influence these metrics. However, the best combination of these elements to optimise engagement is yet to be determined.

## Objective

To ascertain the combination of homepage layout, article headline styles, and featured image types that maximise user engagement on the website.

## Hypothesis

Modifications to the homepage layout, headline styles, and featured images will significantly influence user engagement metrics. Specifically, it is hypothesised that a dynamic homepage layout, action-oriented headlines, and visually compelling images will enhance user interaction.

## Methodology

### Variables for Testing

- **Homepage Layout**
  - A: Static
  - B: Dynamic with rotating articles
  - C: Grid layout
- **Headline Style**
  - 1: Descriptive
  - 2: Action-oriented
  - 3: Question-based
- **Featured Image Type**
  - i: High-resolution photographs
  - ii: Illustrations
  - iii: Graphs and charts

### Test Design

- Employ a multivariate testing tool to create variations featuring combinations of the above variables.
- Ensure equitable distribution of website traffic across all variations to collect reliable data.
- The test should continue for a period sufficient to gather meaningful data, considering time-based factors such as day of the week and time of day.

### Data Collection

- Measure average session duration, pages per session, bounce rate, and social media shares for each variant using web analytics tools.

### Analysis

- Perform statistical analysis to identify the most effective combination of variables.
- Use data visualisation techniques to present the findings, focusing on differences between variations.
