# Chatbots

## Different Types of Chatbots

### Scripted Chatbots

Scripted ai chatbots are chatbots that operate based on pre-determined scripts stored in their library. When a user inputs a query, or in the case of chatbots with speech-to-text conversion modules, speaks a query, the chatbot replies according to the predefined script within its library. One drawback of this type of chatbot is that users must structure their queries very precisely, using comma-separated commands or other regular expressions, to facilitate string analysis and understanding. This makes it challenging to integrate these chatbots with NLP-supported speech-to-text conversion modules, and they are rarely suitable for conversion into intelligent virtual assistants.

### Artificially Intelligent Chatbots

Artificially intelligent ai chatbots, as the name suggests, are designed to mimic human-like traits and responses. NLP (Natural Language Processing) plays a significant role in enabling these chatbots to understand the nuances and subtleties of human conversation. When NLP is combined with artificial intelligence, it results in truly intelligent chatbots capable of responding to nuanced questions and learning from each interaction to provide improved responses in the future. AI chatbots find applications in various platforms, including automated chat support and virtual assistants designed to assist with tasks like recommending songs or restaurants.
