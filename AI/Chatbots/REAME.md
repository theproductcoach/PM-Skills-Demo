# Chatbots

## Different Types of Chatbots

### Scripted

Scripted ai chatbots are chatbots that operate based on pre-determined scripts stored in their library. When a user inputs a query, or in the case of chatbots with speech-to-text conversion modules, speaks a query, the chatbot replies according to the predefined script within its library. One drawback of this type of chatbot is that users must structure their queries very precisely, using comma-separated commands or other regular expressions, to facilitate string analysis and understanding. This makes it challenging to integrate these chatbots with NLP-supported speech-to-text conversion modules, and they are rarely suitable for conversion into intelligent virtual assistants.

### Artificially Intelligent

Artificially intelligent ai chatbots, as the name suggests, are designed to mimic human-like traits and responses. NLP (Natural Language Processing) plays a significant role in enabling these chatbots to understand the nuances and subtleties of human conversation. When NLP is combined with artificial intelligence, it results in truly intelligent chatbots capable of responding to nuanced questions and learning from each interaction to provide improved responses in the future. AI chatbots find applications in various platforms, including automated chat support and virtual assistants designed to assist with tasks like recommending songs or restaurants.

## Real-World Applications

### Scripted Chatbots

#### Customer Service and Support

Scripted chatbots are extensively used in customer service to provide immediate responses to common inquiries. They can handle a wide range of routine questions, such as those about business hours, product availability, and order status, without human intervention. This not only speeds up customer support but also allows human agents to focus on more complex queries, improving overall customer service efficiency.

#### E-commerce and Retail

In the retail sector, scripted chatbots guide customers through the purchasing process. They can offer product recommendations based on predefined criteria, help with size guides, and provide shipping information. By integrating with a website's database, they can also check product availability, thus simplifying the shopping experience for users and driving sales.

#### Booking and Reservations

Scripted chatbots are employed by airlines, hotels, and restaurants for booking and reservations. They can interact with customers to collect travel dates, destination preferences, dining times, and special requests, automatically populating booking forms with this information. This automation streamlines the reservation process, making it faster and more efficient for both businesses and customers.

### Unscripted Chatbots

#### Personalised Customer Interactions

LLM-backed chatbots, with their ability to understand and generate human-like text, provide a more personalised interaction experience. They can handle complex queries, engage in more natural conversations, and adapt their responses based on the context of the interaction. This capability is particularly useful in sectors like finance and healthcare, where customer queries may be more nuanced.

#### Learning and Development

In education and corporate training, unscripted chatbots powered by LLMs offer personalised learning experiences. They can tutor students on a wide range of topics, adapt the teaching style based on the learner's pace, and even assess learner performance through interactive quizzes. This approach makes learning more engaging and tailored to individual needs.

#### Content Creation and Management

Unscripted chatbots are revolutionising content creation, from generating articles and reports to creating marketing copy and social media posts. They can understand specific instructions and produce content that aligns with the desired tone, style, and format. Additionally, in content management, these chatbots can summarise long documents, suggest improvements, and even help organise content libraries, enhancing productivity and creativity.
