# Computer Vision

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.

Computer vision trains machines to perform these functions, but it has to do it in much less time with cameras, data and algorithms rather than retinas, optic nerves and a visual cortex. Because a system trained to inspect products or watch a production asset can analyze thousands of products or processes a minute, noticing imperceptible defects or issues, it can quickly surpass human capabilities.

## Practical Applications

### Healthcare and Medical Imaging

Computer vision is extensively used in the healthcare industry to enhance diagnostic accuracy, patient care, and treatment planning. For instance, algorithms can analyse X-rays, MRI images, and CT scans to detect abnormalities such as tumours, fractures, or diseases at an early stage. This technology can also support surgeons during operations by providing enhanced imaging or real-time data analysis. It plays a crucial role in pathology as well, where computer vision algorithms help in analysing slides to identify diseases like cancer with high precision.

### Autonomous Vehicles and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)

In the automotive industry, computer vision technology is a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle development and advanced driver-assistance systems. It enables cars to perceive their surroundings, detect objects, pedestrians, signs, and lane boundaries to navigate safely. Through the use of cameras and sensors, computer vision systems interpret the captured images to make real-time decisions, such as braking for a pedestrian or navigating around obstacles, enhancing road safety and paving the way for fully autonomous driving.

### Retail and Inventory Management

Computer vision has revolutionised the retail industry by improving customer experience, streamlining inventory management, and enhancing security. In stores, computer vision algorithms can analyse CCTV footage to monitor foot traffic, manage queues, and prevent shoplifting by detecting suspicious behaviours. For inventory management, it can automatically track stock levels by recognising products on shelves, reducing manual stock-taking and improving accuracy. Additionally, some retailers use computer vision in smart checkout systems, allowing customers to simply pick up items and walk out, with the system recognising the products and automatically charging their accounts, thus minimising checkout times and improving the shopping experience.
