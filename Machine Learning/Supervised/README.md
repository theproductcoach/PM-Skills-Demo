# Supervised ML Implementation Example

## Introduction
This is an example to show how to implement a simple supervised ML implementation using python. The model developed will learn and predict the kinds of music people will like, then creating and utilising 'recommendation algorithm'. During my time working as a Product Manager in numerous companies there has been a general lack of infrastructure to implement and support these types of ML solutions. This has led me to instead create this example to demonstrate my understanding and application of the concept.

## Data

The data that is being used is contained in the 'music.csv' file, this is a very simple table with 3 columns: age, gender, and genre. This is the basic data that will be used to create our solution and is reprensentative of known preferences of our customers on an ecommerce website selling music.


## Project Steps

1. Import the Data  
Grab the csv or equivalent you will be using.  
2. Clean the Data  
Plenty of things to consider here: spaces, special characters, empty rows, missing fields etc.  
3. Split the data into training/test sets  
Generally for this you should be using 70-80% of the data for training and the remainder ofr testing  
4. Select an algorithm and build a model  
In this case we're using a decision tree classifier  
5. Train the model  

6. Make predictions with the model  
7. Evaluate Algorithm and Improve Accuracy
