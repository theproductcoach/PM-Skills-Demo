# Neural Networks from Scratch

Welcome to my project repository, where I document my journey through the fascinating world of neural networks, learning to build them from the ground up using Python. This initiative was sparked by my encounter with the YouTube series 'Neural Networks From Scratch', which inspired me to explore the foundational elements of deep learning.

## Why?

The allure of understanding the intricacies behind neural networks and deep learning technologies led me here. The 'Neural Networks From Scratch' series presented an opportunity to peel back the layers of high-level abstractions provided by frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, allowing me to grasp the core principles and mechanics that power these complex systems. My goal is to demystify the magic of neural networks by coding them from scratch, using only Python and its mathematical libraries, to gain a profound understanding of their operations.

## Application

In the realm of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), neural networks have become ubiquitous, silently powering countless applications and services. Despite their widespread usage, there remains a significant gap in the practical understanding of these technologies among many businesses and practitioners. By delving into the nuts and bolts of neural networks, I aim to bridge this gap, equipping myself with the knowledge to not only comprehend but also intelligently apply these solutions in a business context. This project is not just an academic exercise but a step towards making informed decisions on when and how to integrate AI/ML technologies to solve real-world problems effectively.

## Project Structure

- **Tutorials:** Notebooks that follow the series, containing code, explanations, and my personal insights.
- **Resources:** A collection of additional materials, papers, and references that supplement the learning from the series, offering broader context and deeper dives into specific topics.
- **Reflections:** Periodic reflections on what I've learned, challenges faced, and how my understanding of neural networks and their applications has evolved.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Foundational Concepts:** Understanding the mathematical and computational principles underlying neural networks, including activation functions, backpropagation, and gradient descent.
- **Practical Implementation:** Developing the ability to implement these concepts in Python, creating neural networks from scratch without relying on high-level libraries.
- **Problem-Solving:** Applying this knowledge to conceptualise and develop solutions for business and real-world problems, evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of neural networks in various scenarios.

## Looking Forward

As I progress through this series and beyond, I aim to expand my project with more complex models, delve into different types of neural networks (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks), and explore their applications in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics. This journey is not only about learning to code neural networks but about understanding their potential and limitations, and how they can be harnessed to drive innovation and solve challenges in the business world and society at large.
